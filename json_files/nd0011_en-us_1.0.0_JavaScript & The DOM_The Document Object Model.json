Here are the topics for each lesson:\n* **Lesson 1** - The Document Object Model\n* **Lesson 2** - Creating Content with JavaScript\n* **Lesson 3** - Working with Browser Events\n* **Lesson 4** - Performance\n\nIn Lesson 1, we'll take a dive into what the Document Object Model (DOM) is, how it gets created, and how we can access it with JavaScript.\n\nIn Lesson 2, you'll learn to interact with page content using JavaScript. You'll use the skills gained from the first lesson to JavaScript and the DOM to update existing page content, create new page content, add new content to the page, programmatically remove page content, and finally how to style page elements.\n\nIn Lesson 3, you'll learn about browser events. There is an entire world of thousands of browser events that are happening when you interact with a website. You can't see them directly, but you'll learn about them, how to listen for them, and how to respond when they occur.\n\nIn Lesson 4, you'll learn about Performance. It's never too early to start thinking about the performance implications of code. In this course we'll be writing code that can drastically change website (both its content and its looks!), so we need to make sure that the code we write is both functional and efficient.\n\nAs you can see, this course is packed with a ton of information! I hope you're excited to begin!\n",

The browser receives a stream of HTML. The bytes are run through a complicated (but fully documented) parsing process that determines the different characters (e.g. the start tag character `<`, an attribute like `href`, a closing angle bracket like `>`). After parsing has occurred, a process called **tokenization**. Tokenization takes one character at a time and builds up **tokens**. The tokens are:\n\n* DOCTYPE\n* start tag\n* end tag\n* comment\n* character\n* end-of-file\n\nLet's take a break for a second. At this state, the browser has received the bytes that've been sent by a server. The browser has converted the bytes to tags and has read through the tags to create a list of tokens.\n\nThis list of tokens then goes through the tree construction stage. The output of this stage is a tree-like structure - this is the DOM!",

          "text": "## Select An Element By ID\n\nLet's take a look at how we can use JavaScript and the DOM to gain access to specific elements using their ID attribute.\n\nRemember the `document` object from the previous section? Well, we're going to start using it! Remember the `document` object is an object, just like a JavaScript object. This means it has key/value pairs. Some of the values are just pieces of data, while others are functions (also known as **methods**!) that provide some type of functionality. The first DOM method that we'll be looking at is the `.getElementById()` method:\n\n```js\ndocument.getElementById();\n```\n\nIf we ran the code above in the console, we wouldn't get anything, because we did not tell it the ID of any element to get! We need to pass a string to `.getElementById()` of the ID of the element that we want it to find and subsequently return to us:\n\n```js\ndocument.getElementById('footer');\n```\n\nOne thing to notice right off the bat, is that we're passing `'footer'`, not `'#footer'`. It already knows that it's searching for an ID (its name _is_ \"getElementById\", for a reason!).\n\nIf you'd like to read more about this method, check out its documentation page on MDN: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)\n\nLet's use this MDN documentation page to try out using this method.",

Notice the word right in the middle, it's \"Elements\" not \"Element\". If you think about it, this actually makes a lot of sense! Since both `.getElementsByClassName()` and `.getElementsByTagName()` could return multiple items, their method names tell us that directly. Now compare this with `.getElementById()` that will only ever return at most _one_ element. Its name has the singular \"Element\" in it.\n\n> I just wanted to point this out because I've been bitten by that missing \"s\" many-a-time when running code like:\n\n> ```js\ndocument.getElementByClassName('highlight-spanned');\n```\n\n> This code above will _not_ work, because there is no DOM method `.getElementByClassName()` (with singular \"Element\").",

The new DOM methods we looked at are\n* `.querySelector()` - returns a single element\n* `.querySelectorAll()` - returns a list of elements\n\n```js\n// find and return the element with an ID of \"header\"\ndocument.querySelector('#header');\n\n// find and return a list of elements with the class \"header\"\ndocument.querySelectorAll('.header');\n```\n\nWe also took a brief look that the list returned by `.querySelectorAll()` is a NodeList. We saw that it is possible to loop over a NodeList with either its `.forEach()` method, or the humble `for` loop:\n\n```js\nconst allHeaders = document.querySelectorAll('header');\n\nfor(let i = 0; i < allHeaders.length; i++){\n    console.dir(allHeaders[i]);\n}\n```\n",
