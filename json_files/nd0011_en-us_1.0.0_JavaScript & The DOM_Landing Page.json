The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic. \n\nFor this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. If it takes you 3 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 3 hours determining that you wrote the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission. ",

To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks. \n\nTo improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump. \n\nThis may not sound like a lot, but there are a fair amount of moving pieces that rely on each other to work. You’ll need to plan out the logic of what you are trying to accomplish before you begin developing. If you find this process to be quick, there’s a list of additional functionality that you can add that all strive to improve the users’ experience. ",

          "text": "# Development Strategy\n\nFor this project, you will be writing most of your code in **js/app.js**. Note that it's very important that you *plan your project* before you start writing any code! Break your project down into *small* pieces of work and strategize your approach to each one. With these bite-sized amounts, it'll be easier to debug and fix any issues that appear.\n\nFeel free to implement your own design workflow, but if you get stuck -- here is a walkthrough to get you up and running!\n\n1. **Start by linking your app.js**. where should this file go based on your present knowledge? We’ll test some other locations later. \n2. **Build out your HTML and at least 3 content sections**. The rest of your functionality relies on these sections.\n  - Take a quick look at all the HTML elements in **index.html**. Note the values for their `id`, `class`, and `data` attributes. To manipulate the DOM, you'll be using many of the tools and methods you've learned on these elements (and on those that you will create). \n    - For a refresher on the data attribute, visit [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_data-.asp).\n  - Which data structure can you use to store these sections? This data structure can represent all sections for your page, so it might be a good idea to save it to a variable.\n  - How you would iterate (i.e., loop) over this data structure?\n  - Think about how you can create, say, an *unordered list* (i.e., bulleted list) in HTML from this structure, and where you be placing that list.\n  - Think about how you’ll test whether a section is in the viewport.\n  - What actions are you performing that will cause interactivity with the DOM?\n3. **Build the navigation menu**. This will dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page. This can be a particularly useful trick when you begin working with content management systems or APIs when you are uncertain of the items will be. \n  - Are you listening for an event for the navigation to build?\n  - Where are you placing the navigation? \n  - Where is the text for each navigation item coming from and where are you anchoring to? \n  - How are you going to add each navigation item to your menu? (Hint: there are several ways to do this. Do some research to figure out which makes the most sense for your situation. Performance? Clarity?).\n4. **Add functionality to distinguish the section in view**. While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections.  \n  - Are you listening for an event for sections to become active?\n  - How are you going to test which section should be highlighted? \n  - How can we use `classList` [methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList#Methods) to change the CSS being displayed? What about removing that CSS?\n  - Check the HTML and CSS files to ensure that what you chose is updated in the other locations. \n5. **Add the functionality to scroll to sections**. Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page.\n  - Which event are you listening for (hint: you were just reading it)?\n  - There is a default event occurring that we need to stop. How?\n  - If you don’t recall how HTML page anchors work, [read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#Examples) to figure out which variables you should set. \n  - There are several javascript methods for scrolling. Which seems like it may be the most simple? \n6. **REFACTOR**. At this point, your code should be working properly. Ideally, refactoring happens while you are developing, but as a new developer, you often don’t have the whole picture in your head to be able to do so properly.  Let’s clean the project up. \n  - Have you run your code through a linter? We request you still follow Udacity standards when the code is complete, but running it through an [eslinter](https://eslint.org/demo) is going to help you get started in refactoring. \n  - Are you using ES6 const and let? \n  - Are all your functions using ES6 arrow functions?\n  - Is your code DRY? Are there any pieces that would be better served as a helper function to avoid duplication?\n  - How is your code structured? Have you created functions for the main functionality with properly scoped variables? Starting out it’s likely that you will have a globally scoped variables on occasion until you learn more about closures and design patterns. But placing your code into functions is a great way to make your code more readable and a way to avoid globally scoped variables. \n  - Are you using the best method for your iterations? \n7. **Add additional sections to your HTML document**. See how the navigation builds. \n8. **Test the performance**. The performance of your page can be affected by how you write your javascript as well as where you load your javascript. \n  - Test loading the javascript in the head vs at the end of the body. What issues arise? Is there a way to still load in the head without breaking the page? What is the performance like compared to loading at the end of the body?\n9. **Suggested**: \n  - Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport. \n  - Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load). \n    - Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling. \n  - Add a scroll to top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page. \n  - Update/change the design/content. \n  - Make sections collapsible.",
